## View Parser

### Overview

This parser works locally and in your terminal/CLI only. It takes inputs, traverses a nested object (similar to the DOM tree), and responds with the 'views' that match the key value pair.

### How to use

After you clone the repo run the following command:

```
node index.js
```

Follow the prompts to find views by class, css class name, or identifier.

To return the FULL object type 'identifier' on the first prompt and 'system' for the second (if using onboard JSON file).
